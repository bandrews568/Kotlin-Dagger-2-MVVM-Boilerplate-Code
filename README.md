# Kotlin-Dagger-2-MVVM-Boilerplate-Code
Kotlin boilerplate code to setup Android Architecture Components using Dagger 2 for dependency injection.

Includes boilerplate code for unit and UI testing.
- Any activities that use Dagger to inject dependencies must be open classes and mocked in the TestApp class.
  Looking for a more elegant solution but this works for now.
